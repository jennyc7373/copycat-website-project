The purpose of this Copycat-Website project was to use it as a practice before making my own website for the freedom project. In this project, I would use all the HTML and CSS that I learned from codecamp to make a copy of a website. So I chose PupilPath as the website to make a copy of. Before I started writing the code I made a plan of how I will make this copy and organize steps of making it. While I was making the plan I didnâ€™t think it would be hard to make a copy of PupilPath because it looked pretty simple. However, when I start writing the code I faced some challenges. A challenge was the picture of the PupilPath logo is always staying on the left side of the page. The margin(left/right) did not help me fix the position of the logo. Then I learned about display: block;. Display: block will take a section of the page and will ignore all HTML. So the problem was the HTML code getting in the way of the position of the logo, and by separating it will allow me to set it to any position. Although I faced challenges I also learned how to use display which might be useful for future projects or maybe used in my freedom project.
